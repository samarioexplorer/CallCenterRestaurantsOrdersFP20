WELCOME TO FP20 ANALYTICS CHALLENGE 6 " Restaurant Food Delivery Analysis" 

ABOUT  
Welcome to FP20 Analytics Challenge 6! With this challenge, we delve into the world of food
delivery services, a rapidly evolving market that is shaping the future of the restaurant industry.
As more and more people opt for the convenience of having food delivered right to their
doorstep, understanding the underlying dynamics of this industry becomes increasingly
important.

THE BRIEF
*IMPORTANT*
In this challenge, you will be given access to a rich data set that covers a variety of variables
related to food delivery. 
Your task is to analyze this data and uncover insights that could help improve efficiency,
profitability, and customer satisfaction. You will need to interpret the data, identify key trends
and patterns, and present your findings in a clear, comprehensive, and compelling way. 

While it's encouraged to explore the dataset and come up with unique and innovative KPIs, here
are a few potential metrics that participants could consider for our client: 
1. Average Delivery Time: The time it takes from when an order is placed to when it is
delivered. This KPI is crucial for measuring the efficiency of the delivery service. 
2. Driver Efficiency: This can be determined by calculating the number of deliveries
completed per hour by each driver. 
3. Order Completion Rate: The percentage of orders that are successfully delivered versus
those that are refunded. This can be a measure of customer satisfaction and operational
efficiency. 
4. Average Tip per Delivery: This can serve as a proxy for customer satisfaction and could
be used to reward high-performing drivers. 
5. Peak Ordering Times: Understanding when most orders are placed can help with
resource allocation and planning. 
Remember, the aim of this challenge is not just to calculate these KPIs but to leverage them to
extract valuable insights and recommendations that can drive business strategy and improve
service delivery. Good luck to all participants!
